# R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks)

## Overview

R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) is a deep learning model for object detection that works by generating region proposals and classifying them with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is designed to localize and identify objects within images by following a three-stage process: region proposal, feature extraction, and classification.

## Key Features

- **Region Proposal**: R-CNN generates possible bounding boxes (regions of interest) using selective search, which allows the model to focus on areas where objects are likely to appear.
- **Feature Extraction**: Each proposed region is passed through a CNN (e.g., VGG16) to extract feature vectors that capture important information about the content of the region.
- **Classification**: After feature extraction, a support vector machine (SVM) classifies each region based on the learned features. Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is applied to remove redundant predictions.

## How It Works

1. **Region Proposal**: Selective search is used to generate potential object regions within the image. These regions are bounding boxes that might contain objects.
2. **Feature Extraction**: A pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16) is used to extract features from each proposed region. The CNN transforms the regions into feature vectors.
3. **Classification**: A linear SVM classifier is applied to each regionâ€™s feature vector to determine if it contains an object, and which class it belongs to.
4. **Bounding Box Regression**: The network also learns to predict the correct bounding box for each detected object using a regression model.
